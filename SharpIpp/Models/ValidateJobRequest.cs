    ///     except that a client supplies no document data and
    ///     the Printer allocates no resources (i.e., it does not create a new
    ///     Job object).  This operation is used only to verify capabilities of a
    ///     printer object against whatever attributes are supplied by the client
    ///     in the Validate-Job request.  By using the Validate-Job operation a
    ///     client can validate that an identical Print-Job operation (with the
    ///     document data) would be accepted. The Validate-Job operation also
    ///     performs the same security negotiation as the Print-Job operation
    ///     (see section 8), so that a client can check that the client and
    ///     Printer object security requirements can be met before performing a
    ///     Print-Job operation.
