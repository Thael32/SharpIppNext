    ///     were submitted to the device from other sources than the IPP Printer
    ///     object in the same way that the Purge-Jobs operation affects jobs
    ///     that were submitted to the IPP Printer object using IPP, depends on
    ///     implementation, i.e., on whether the IPP protocol is being used as a
    ///     universal management protocol or just to manage IPP jobs,
